# Suicide Prevention Bot
## Abstract
In recent times, we see an increase in mental health issues, and a critical need for accessing support systems should be made available to individuals who are hesitant to share their mental situation aspects with their parents or friends.
The Suicide Prevention Therapy ChatBot uses advanced LLMs to provide empathetic crisis support and initial therapeutic advice. It‚Äôs designed for natural, human-like interaction, serving as a first-contact support system for individuals hesitant to seek help, addressing the urgent need for accessible mental health care.


## Introduction

In recent times, we see an increase in mental health issues, and a critical need for accessing support systems should be made available to individuals who are hesitant to share their mental situation aspects with their parents or friends.
The Suicide Prevention Therapy ChatBot uses advanced LLMs to provide empathetic crisis support and initial therapeutic advice. It‚Äôs designed for natural, human-like interaction, serving as a first-contact support system for individuals hesitant to seek help, addressing the urgent need for accessible mental health care.



## objective
- Increase accessibility to mental health support.
- Promote mental well-being and reduce stigma associated with seeking help.
- Reduce suicide attempts through timely intervention.

This project uses the following technologies:
- **Python** for backend logic.
- **LangChain** for NLP-based queries.
- **Pinecone** for vector storage.
- **Google Speech-to-Text API** for voice transcriptions.
- **TextBlob** for mood detection.
- **Chainlit** for chatbot interactions.

## Features

- **Compassionate Therapy Assistant:** Provides empathetic responses based on the emotional tone of user interactions.
- **Voice Message Support:** Records and transcribes voice inputs.
- **Mood Detection:** Analyzes user messages to determine mood (happy, sad, or neutral).
- **Motivational Stories:** Fetches motivational stories based on detected mood.
- **Geolocation Tracking:** Captures geolocation data to notify in emergencies.
- **Suicide Detection and Notification:** Sends email alerts with relevant conversation and location data.

## Models and APIs Used
1. **LangChain:**
   -LangChain is used for handling the Natural Language Processing (NLP) part of the chatbot. It helps the bot understand user queries and generate appropriate responses based on the conversation context.

   -LangChain facilitates the interaction between the bot and the various models, enabling dynamic conversation handling and improving the overall user experience.

2. **Pinecone:**
   -Pinecone is used for vector-based storage and search. The system creates embeddings for PDF documents that can be queried by the chatbot to fetch relevant information when needed. This helps the bot respond with context-specific information, improving the accuracy of its responses.
3. **Google Speech-to-Text API:**
   -The Google Speech-to-Text API is integrated into the bot to handle voice messages. It converts spoken words into text, allowing the user to interact with the bot through voice instead of just typing. This makes the chatbot more accessible to a larger audience.
   -The API converts speech to text in real-time, enhancing the chatbot‚Äôs functionality, especially in emergency or crisis situations.

4. **TextBlob:**
   -TextBlob is used for sentiment analysis to detect the user's mood based on their input. The bot analyzes the sentiment of the message to understand if the user is feeling sad, happy, or neutral, and responds accordingly.
   -This helps the bot detect emotional distress, an important feature for identifying when a user may be at risk.

5. **SMTP:**
   -The SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) service is used to send email notifications. When the bot detects certain crisis indicators or suicide-related keywords, it sends an email alert to a specified email address with details of the conversation and the user's geolocation.
   -This ensures timely intervention by relevant parties such as mental health professionals or loved ones.

6. **Geolocation API:**
   -The Geolocation API is used to track the user's location when necessary, especially in cases of emergency. The bot can use this information to provide more accurate notifications to relevant authorities or loved ones.


   
## How It Works
1. **PDF Processing:**
   - The `embedding.py` script processes multiple PDF files, splits them into chunks, and creates embeddings using Pinecone.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - The chatbot (`bot2.py`) handles user inputs, both text and voice, via Chainlit.

3. **Mood Analysis:**
   - Mood is detected using TextBlob's sentiment analysis. Based on the mood, the bot fetches motivational stories.

4. **Emergency Notifications:**
   - If suicide-related keywords are detected, an email with the conversation and geolocation is sent to a specified contact.
