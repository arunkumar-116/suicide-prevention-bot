I've been feeling really down lately, and I don't know how to handle it. Can you help?

I guess I've just been feeling like nothing I do is good enough, and it's hard to stay motivated. How do I stop feeling like this?

I've been thinking about suicide lately because I feel like there's no other way to escape this pain.
